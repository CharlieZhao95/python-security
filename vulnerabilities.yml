  description: >
    A vulnerability in smtplib allowing MITM attacker to perform a startTLS
    stripping attack. smtplib does not seem to raise an exception when the
    remote end (SMTP server) is capable of negotiating starttls but fails to
    respond with 220 (ok) to an explicit call of SMTP.starttls(). This may
    allow a malicious MITM to perform a startTLS stripping attack if the client
    code does not explicitly check the response code for startTLS.

    Reported by Tin (Team Oststrom).

    If the name in the certificate contains many "*" characters, matching the

    Certificate validation happens before host name checking, so I think this
    is a minor issue only because it can only be triggered in cooperation with
    a CA (which seems unlikely).
