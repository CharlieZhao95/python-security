This makes it easy to test feeds before passing       them to 0repo.\n\nBug fixes :\n\n  - Better handling of default=' in <environment> bindings.\n    This now specifies that the default should be ',     overriding any system default.\n\n    - Fixed --refresh with 'download' and 'run' for apps.\n\n    - Updated ssl_match_hostname based on latest bug-fixes.\n      This fix is intended to fix a denial-of-service       attack, which doesn't really matter to 0install, but       we might as well have the latest version.\n      CVE-2013-2099\n\n    - Better error when the <rename> source does not exist.\n\n    - Allow selecting local archives even in offline mode.\n\n    - Support the use of the system store with recipes. This       is especially important now that we treat all       downloads as recipes!\n\n    - Removed old zeroinstall-add.desktop file.\n\nChanges for APIs we depend on\n\n  - Cope with more PyGObject API changes. Based on patch in     http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/6369\n\n  - Keep gobject and glib separate. Sometimes we need GLib,     sometimes we need GObject.\n\n    - Updates to avoid PyGIDeprecationWarning.\n\nNote that Tenable Network Security has extracted the preceding description block directly from the Fedora security advisory.

A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the References section.\n\nThe cloud-init packages provide a set of init scripts for cloud instances. Cloud instances need special scripts to run during initialization to retrieve and install ssh keys and to let the user run various scripts.\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way Python's SSL module implementation performed matching of certain certificate names. A remote attacker able to obtain a valid certificate that contained multiple wildcard characters could use this flaw to issue a request to validate such a certificate, resulting in excessive consumption of CPU. (CVE-2013-2099)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.\n\nThe cloud-init packages have been upgraded to upstream version 0.7.5, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version. (BZ#1111709, BZ#1119334)\n\nAll cloud-init users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements.",
