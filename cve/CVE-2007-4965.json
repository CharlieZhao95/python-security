            "description": "Red Hat Network Satellite Server version 4.2.3 is now available. This update includes fixes for a number of security issues in Red Hat Network Satellite Server Solaris client components.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red Hat Security Response Team.\n\nThis release corrects several security vulnerabilities in various components shipped as part of the Red Hat Network Satellite Server Solaris client. In a typical operating environment, these components are not used by the Satellite Server in a vulnerable manner. These security updates will reduce risk should these components be used by other applications.\n\nSeveral flaws in Zlib was discovered. An attacker could create a carefully-crafted compressed stream that would cause an application to crash if the stream is opened by a user. (CVE-2005-2096). An attacker could create a carefully crafted compressed stream that would cause an application to crash if the stream is opened by a user.\n(CVE-2005-1849)\n\nA buffer overflow was discovered in the OpenSSL SSL_get_shared_ciphers() utility function. An attacker could send a list of ciphers to an application that used this function and overrun a buffer (CVE-2006-3738).\n\nA flaw in the SSLv2 client code was discovered. If a client application used OpenSSL to create an SSLv2 connection to a malicious server, that server could cause the client to crash. (CVE-2006-4343)\n\nAn attack on OpenSSL PKCS #1 v1.5 signatures was discovered. Where an RSA key with exponent 3 is used it may be possible for an attacker to forge a PKCS #1 v1.5 signature that would be incorrectly verified by implementations that do not check for excess data in the RSA exponentiation result of the signature. This issue affected applications that use OpenSSL to verify X.509 certificates as well as other uses of PKCS #1 v1.5. (CVE-2006-4339)\n\nOpenSSL contained a software work-around for a bug in SSL handling in Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.0.2. It is enabled in most servers that use OpenSSL to provide support for SSL and TLS. This work-around could allow an attacker, acting as a 'man in the middle' to force an SSL connection to use SSL 2.0 rather than a stronger protocol, such as SSL 3.0 or TLS 1.0. (CVE-2005-2969)\n\nDuring OpenSSL parsing of certain invalid ASN.1 structures an error condition was mishandled. This can result in an infinite loop which consumed system memory (CVE-2006-2937).\n\nCertain public key types can take disproportionate amounts of time to process in OpenSSL, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2006-2940)\n\nA flaw was discovered in the way that the Python repr() function handled UTF-32/UCS-4 strings. If an application written in Python used the repr() function on untrusted data, this could lead to a denial of service or possibly allow the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the Python application. (CVE-2006-4980)\n\nA flaw was discovered in the strxfrm() function of Python's locale module. Strings generated by this function were not properly NULL-terminated. This may possibly cause disclosure of data stored in the memory of a Python application using this function.\n(CVE-2007-2052)\n\nMultiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in Python's imageop module. If an application written in Python used the imageop module to process untrusted images, it could cause the application to crash, enter an infinite loop, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Python interpreter. (CVE-2007-4965)\n\nA stack-based buffer overflow was discovered in the Python interpreter, which could allow a local user to gain privileges by running a script with a long name from the current working directory.\n(CVE-2006-1542)\n\nUsers of Red Hat Network Satellite Server should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.",

Updated Service Console package kernel\n\n  Updated Service Console package kernel addresses the security   issues listed below.\n\n  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the names CVE-2008-3528, CVE-2008-5700, CVE-2009-0028,   CVE-2009-0269, CVE-2009-0322, CVE-2009-0675, CVE-2009-0676,   CVE-2009-0778 to the security issues fixed in kernel   2.6.18-128.1.6.\n\n  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the names CVE-2008-4307, CVE-2009-0834, CVE-2009-1337,   CVE-2009-0787, CVE-2009-1336 to the security issues fixed in   kernel 2.6.18-128.1.10.\n\n  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the names CVE-2009-1439, CVE-2009-1633, CVE-2009-1072,   CVE-2009-1630, CVE-2009-1192 to the security issues fixed in   kernel 2.6.18-128.1.14.\n\n  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the names CVE-2007-5966, CVE-2009-1385, CVE-2009-1388,   CVE-2009-1389, CVE-2009-1895, CVE-2009-2406, CVE-2009-2407 to the   security issues fixed in kernel 2.6.18-128.4.1.\n\n  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the names CVE-2009-2692, CVE-2009-2698 to the   security issues fixed in kernel 2.6.18-128.7.1.\n\n  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the names CVE-2009-0745, CVE-2009-0746, CVE-2009-0747,   CVE-2009-0748, CVE-2009-2847, CVE-2009-2848 to the security issues   fixed in kernel 2.6.18-164.\n\n f. Updated Service Console package python\n\n  Service Console package Python update to version 2.4.3-24.el5.\n\n  When the assert() system call was disabled, an input sanitization   flaw was revealed in the Python string object implementation that   led to a buffer overflow. The missing check for negative size values   meant the Python memory allocator could allocate less memory than   expected. This could result in arbitrary code execution with the   Python interpreter's privileges.\n\n  Multiple buffer and integer overflow flaws were found in the Python   Unicode string processing and in the Python Unicode and string   object implementations. An attacker could use these flaws to cause   a denial of service.\n\n  Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the Python imageop   module. If a Python application used the imageop module to   process untrusted images, it could cause the application to   disclose sensitive information, crash or, potentially, execute   arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.\n\n  Multiple integer underflow and overflow flaws were found in the   Python snprintf() wrapper implementation. An attacker could use   these flaws to cause a denial of service (memory corruption).\n\n  Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in various Python   modules. An attacker could use these flaws to cause a denial of   service.\n\n  An integer signedness error, leading to a buffer overflow, was   found in the Python zlib extension module. If a Python application   requested the negative byte count be flushed for a decompression   stream, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially,   execute arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.\n\n  A flaw was discovered in the strxfrm() function of the Python   locale module. Strings generated by this function were not properly   NULL-terminated, which could possibly cause disclosure of data   stored in the memory of a Python application using this function.\n\n  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the names CVE-2007-2052 CVE-2007-4965 CVE-2008-1721   CVE-2008-1887 CVE-2008-2315 CVE-2008-3142 CVE-2008-3143   CVE-2008-3144 CVE-2008-4864 CVE-2008-5031 to these issues.\n\n g. Updated Service Console package bind\n\n  Service Console package bind updated to version 9.3.6-4.P1.el5\n\n  The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the   Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server   (named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when   interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server   is operating correctly.\n\n  A flaw was found in the way BIND handles dynamic update message   packets containing the 'ANY' record type. A remote attacker could   use this flaw to send a specially crafted dynamic update packet   that could cause named to exit with an assertion failure.\n\n  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the name CVE-2009-0696 to this issue.\n\n h. Updated Service Console package libxml2\n\n  Service Console package libxml2 updated to version 2.6.26-2.1.2.8.\n\n  libxml is a library for parsing and manipulating XML files. A   Document Type Definition (DTD) defines the legal syntax (and also   which elements can be used) for certain types of files, such as XML   files.\n\n  A stack overflow flaw was found in the way libxml processes the   root XML document element definition in a DTD. A remote attacker   could provide a specially crafted XML file, which once opened by a   local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.\n\n  Multiple use-after-free flaws were found in the way libxml parses   the Notation and Enumeration attribute types. A remote attacker   could provide a specially crafted XML file, which once opened by a   local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.\n\n  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the names CVE-2009-2414 and CVE-2009-2416 to these   issues.\n\n i. Updated Service Console package curl\n\n  Service Console package curl updated to version 7.15.5-2.1.el5_3.5\n\n  A cURL is affected by the previously published 'null prefix attack',   caused by incorrect handling of NULL characters in X.509   certificates. If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted   certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, the attacker   could use the certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and   potentially confuse cURL into accepting it by mistake.\n\n  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the name CVE-2009-2417 to this issue\n\n j. Updated Service Console package gnutls\n\n  Service Console package gnutil updated to version 1.4.1-3.el5_3.5\n\n  A flaw was discovered in the way GnuTLS handles NULL characters in   certain fields of X.509 certificates. If an attacker is able to get   a carefully-crafted certificate signed by a Certificate Authority   trusted by an application using GnuTLS, the attacker could use the   certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially   confuse the application into accepting it by mistake.\n\n  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the name CVE-2009-2730 to this issue",

            "description": "I  Updated ESX driver\n\n    a. Updated aacraid driver\n\n       This patch fixes a flaw in how the aacraid SCSI driver checked        IOCTL command permissions.  This flaw might allow a local user        on the Service Console to cause a denial of service or gain        privileges. Thanks to Adaptec for reporting this issue.\n\n       The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)        has assigned the name CVE-2007-4308 to this issue.\n\nII  Service Console package security updates\n\n    a. Samba\n\n       Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research found a stack-based buffer overflow        flaw in the way Samba authenticates remote users.  A remote        unauthenticated user could trigger this flaw to cause the Samba        server to crash or to execute arbitrary code with the        permissions of the Samba server.\n\n       Note: This vulnerability can be exploited only if the attacker              has access to the Service Console network.  The Samba              client is installed by default in the Service Console, but              the Samba server is not.\n\n       The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)        has assigned the name CVE-2007-6015 to this issue.\n\n    b. Python\n\n       Chris Evans of the Google security research team discovered an        integer overflow issue with the way Python's Perl-Compatible        Regular Expression (PCRE) module handled certain regular        expressions.  If a Python application used the PCRE module to        compile and execute untrusted regular expressions, it might be        possible to cause the application to crash, or to execute        arbitrary code with the privileges of the Python interpreter.\n\n       The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)        has assigned the name CVE-2006-7228 to this issue.\n\n       Piotr Engelking discovered a flaw in Python's locale module        where strings generated by the strxfrm() function were not        properly NUL-terminated.  This might result in disclosure of        data stored in the memory of a Python application using the        strxfrm() function.\n\n       The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)        has assigned the name CVE-2007-2052 to this issue.\n\n       Slythers Bro reported multiple integer overflow flaws in        Python's imageop module.  These could allow an attacker to cause        a Python application to crash, enter an infinite loop, or        possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the        Python interpreter.\n\n       The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)        has assigned the name CVE-2007-4965 to this issue.",
