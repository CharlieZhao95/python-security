The schizophrenic result is that many MS-based systems are required to understand both forms of the slash.

            "description": "The version of MySQL running on the remote host is 5.7.x prior to 5.7.16. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities :\n\n  - Multiple integer overflow conditions exist in s3_srvr.c,     ssl_sess.c, and t1_lib.c due to improper use of pointer     arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to     cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-2177)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the     dsa_sign_setup() function in dsa_ossl.c due to a failure     to properly ensure the use of constant-time operations.\n    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,     via a timing side-channel attack, to disclose DSA key     information. (CVE-2016-2178)\n\n  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the DTLS     implementation due to a failure to properly restrict the     lifetime of queue entries associated with unused     out-of-order messages. An unauthenticated, remote     attacker can exploit this, by maintaining multiple     crafted DTLS sessions simultaneously, to exhaust memory.\n    (CVE-2016-2179)\n\n  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the X.509 Public     Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP)     implementation. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can     exploit this, via a crafted time-stamp file that is     mishandled by the 'openssl ts' command, to cause     denial of service or to disclose sensitive information.\n    (CVE-2016-2180)\n\n  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the     Anti-Replay feature in the DTLS implementation due to     improper handling of epoch sequence numbers in records.\n    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,     via spoofed DTLS records, to cause legitimate packets to     be dropped. (CVE-2016-2181)\n\n  - An overflow condition exists in the BN_bn2dec() function     in bn_print.c due to improper validation of     user-supplied input when handling BIGNUM values. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to     crash the process. (CVE-2016-2182)\n\n  - A vulnerability exists, known as SWEET32, in the 3DES     and Blowfish algorithms due to the use of weak 64-bit     block ciphers by default. A man-in-the-middle attacker     who has sufficient resources can exploit this     vulnerability, via a 'birthday' attack, to detect a     collision that leaks the XOR between the fixed secret     and a known plaintext, allowing the disclosure of the     secret text, such as secure HTTPS cookies, and possibly     resulting in the hijacking of an authenticated session.\n    (CVE-2016-2183)\n\n  - An unspecified flaw exists in the Security: Encryption     subcomponent that allows an authenticated, remote     attacker to disclose sensitive information.\n    (CVE-2016-5584)\n\n  - A flaw exists in the tls_decrypt_ticket() function in     t1_lib.c due to improper handling of ticket HMAC     digests. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit     this, via a ticket that is too short, to crash the     process, resulting in a denial of service.\n    (CVE-2016-6302)\n\n  - An integer overflow condition exists in the     MDC2_Update() function in mdc2dgst.c due to improper     validation of user-supplied input. An unauthenticated,     remote attacker can exploit this to cause a heap-based     buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service     condition or possibly the execution of arbitrary code.\n    (CVE-2016-6303)\n\n  - A flaw exists in the ssl_parse_clienthello_tlsext()     function in t1_lib.c due to improper handling of overly     large OCSP Status Request extensions from clients. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via     large OCSP Status Request extensions, to exhaust memory     resources, resulting in a denial of service condition.\n    (CVE-2016-6304)\n\n  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the certificate     parser that allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker     to cause a denial of service via crafted certificate     operations. (CVE-2016-6306)\n\n  - A flaw exists in the check_log_path() function within     file sql/sys_vars.cc due to inadequate restrictions on     the ability to write to the my.cnf configuration file     and allowing the loading of configuration files from     path locations not used by current versions. An     authenticated, remote attacker can exploit this issue     by using specially crafted queries that utilize logging     functionality to create new files or append custom     content to existing files. This allows the attacker to     gain root privileges by inserting a custom .cnf file     with a 'malloc_lib=' directive pointing to specially     crafted mysql_hookandroot_lib.so file and thereby cause     MySQL to load a malicious library the next time it is     started. (CVE-2016-6662)\n\n  - A flaw exists in wolfSSL, specifically within the C     software version of AES Encryption and Decryption, due     to table lookups not properly considering cache-bank     access times. A local attacker can exploit this, via a     specially crafted application, to disclose AES keys.\n    (CVE-2016-7440)\n\nNote that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.",

This was incorrect; the erratum is an update, not a replacement. The erratum text has been modified to reflect this.\n\nRed Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java applications based on the JBoss Application Server.\n\nThis release provides an update to httpd and OpenSSL. The updates are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.\n\nThe httpd packages provide the Apache HTTP Server, a powerful, efficient, and extensible web server.\n\nOpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, as well as a full-strength general-purpose cryptography library.\n\nThis release of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.18 Natives serves as an update to the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.16 Natives and includes bug fixes which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4 Natives are advised to upgrade to these updated packages.\n\nSecurity Fix(es) :\n\n* It was discovered that the httpd's mod_auth_digest module did not properly initialize memory before using it when processing certain headers related to digest authentication. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to disclose potentially sensitive information or cause httpd child process to crash by sending specially crafted requests to a server.

An attacker can exploit     this to gain access to RSA key information.\n    (CVE-2016-0702)\n\n  - A flaw exists in the SSLv2 implementation,     specifically in the get_client_master_key() function     within file s2_srvr.c, due to accepting a nonzero     CLIENT-MASTER-KEY CLEAR-KEY-LENGTH value for an     arbitrary cipher. A man-in-the-middle attacker can     exploit this to determine the MASTER-KEY value and     decrypt TLS ciphertext by leveraging a Bleichenbacher     RSA padding oracle. (CVE-2016-0703)\n\n  - A flaw exists in the SSLv2 oracle protection mechanism,     specifically in the get_client_master_key() function     within file s2_srvr.c, due to incorrectly overwriting     MASTER-KEY bytes during use of export cipher suites.\n    A remote attackers can exploit this to more easily     decrypt TLS ciphertext by leveraging a Bleichenbacher     RSA padding oracle. (CVE-2016-0704)\n\n  - A double-free error exists due to improper validation of     user-supplied input when parsing malformed DSA private     keys. A remote attacker can exploit this to corrupt     memory, resulting in a denial of service condition or     the execution of arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-0705)\n\n  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the     BN_hex2bn() and BN_dec2bn() functions. A remote attacker     can exploit this to trigger a heap corruption, resulting     in the execution of arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-0797)\n\n  - A denial of service vulnerability exists due to improper     handling of invalid usernames. A remote attacker can     exploit this, via a specially crafted username, to leak     300 bytes of memory per connection, exhausting available     memory resources. (CVE-2016-0798)\n\n  - Multiple memory corruption issues exist that allow a     remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition     or the execution of arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-0799)\n\n  - A heap buffer overflow condition exists in the     EVP_EncodeUpdate() function within file     crypto/evp/encode.c that is triggered when handling     a large amount of input data. An unauthenticated, remote     attacker can exploit this to cause a denial of service     condition. (CVE-2016-2105)\n\n  - A heap buffer overflow condition exists in the     EVP_EncryptUpdate() function within file     crypto/evp/evp_enc.c that is triggered when handling a     large amount of input data after a previous call occurs     to the same function with a partial block. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to     cause a denial of service condition. (CVE-2016-2106)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the     ASN.1 encoder due to an underflow condition that occurs     when attempting to encode the value zero represented as     a negative integer. An unauthenticated, remote attacker     can exploit this to corrupt memory, resulting in the     execution of arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2108)\n\n  - Multiple unspecified flaws exist in the d2i BIO     functions when reading ASN.1 data from a BIO due to     invalid encoding causing a large allocation of memory.\n    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit these to     cause a denial of service condition through resource     exhaustion. (CVE-2016-2109)\n\n  - Multiple integer overflow conditions exist in s3_srvr.c,     ssl_sess.c, and t1_lib.c due to improper use of pointer     arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to     cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-2177)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the     dsa_sign_setup() function in dsa_ossl.c due to a failure     to properly ensure the use of constant-time operations.\n    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,     via a timing side-channel attack, to disclose DSA key     information. (CVE-2016-2178)\n\n  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the X.509 Public     Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP)     implementation. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can     exploit this, via a crafted time-stamp file that is     mishandled by the 'openssl ts' command, to cause     denial of service or to disclose sensitive information.\n    (CVE-2016-2180)\n\n  - An overflow condition exists in the BN_bn2dec() function     in bn_print.c due to improper validation of     user-supplied input when handling BIGNUM values. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to     crash the process. (CVE-2016-2182)\n\n  - A vulnerability exists, known as SWEET32, in the 3DES     and Blowfish algorithms due to the use of weak 64-bit     block ciphers by default. A man-in-the-middle attacker     who has sufficient resources can exploit this     vulnerability, via a 'birthday' attack, to detect a     collision that leaks the XOR between the fixed secret     and a known plaintext, allowing the disclosure of the     secret text, such as secure HTTPS cookies, and possibly     resulting in the hijacking of an authenticated session.\n    (CVE-2016-2183)\n\n  - A flaw exists in the tls_decrypt_ticket() function in     t1_lib.c due to improper handling of ticket HMAC     digests. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit     this, via a ticket that is too short, to crash the     process, resulting in a denial of service.\n    (CVE-2016-6302)\n\n  - An integer overflow condition exists in the     MDC2_Update() function in mdc2dgst.c due to improper     validation of user-supplied input. An unauthenticated,     remote attacker can exploit this to cause a heap-based     buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service     condition or possibly the execution of arbitrary code.\n    (CVE-2016-6303)\n\n  - A flaw exists in the ssl_parse_clienthello_tlsext()     function in t1_lib.c due to improper handling of overly     large OCSP Status Request extensions from clients. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via     large OCSP Status Request extensions, to exhaust memory     resources, resulting in a denial of service condition.\n    (CVE-2016-6304)\n\n  - A flaw exists in the SSL_peek() function in     rec_layer_s3.c due to improper handling of empty     records. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit     this, by triggering a zero-length record in an SSL_peek     call, to cause an infinite loop, resulting in a denial     of service condition. (CVE-2016-6305)\n\n  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the certificate     parser that allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker     to cause a denial of service via crafted certificate     operations. (CVE-2016-6306)\n\n  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the     state-machine implementation due to a failure to check     for an excessive length before allocating memory. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via a     crafted TLS message, to exhaust memory resources.\n    (CVE-2016-6307)\n\nNote that these issues only affects devices with J-Web or the SSL service for JUNOScript enabled.",

An unauthenticated, remote attacker     can exploit this, via a crafted XML file, to cause a     denial of service condition or the execution of arbitary     code. (CVE-2011-1944)\n\n  - An integer overflow condition exists in the HTTP server,     specifically in the ap_pregsub() function within file     server/util.c, when the mod_setenvif module is enabled.\n    A local attacker can exploit this to gain elevated     privileges by using an .htaccess file with a crafted     combination of SetEnvIf directives and HTTP request     headers. (CVE-2011-3607)\n\n  - A flaw exists in libxml2, known as the 'internal entity     expansion' with linear complexity issue, that allows     specially crafted XML files to consume excessive CPU and     memory resources. An unauthenticated, remote attacker     can exploit this to cause a denial of service condition     by using a specially crafted XML file containing an     entity declaration with long replacement text and many     references to this entity. (CVE-2013-0338)\n\n  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in libxml2 within     file parser.c due to a failure to check for the     XML_PARSER_EOF state. An unauthenticated, remote     attacker can exploit this, via a specially crafted     document that ends abruptly, to cause a denial of     service condition. (CVE-2013-2877)\n\n  - A flaw exists within the mod_headers module in the     HTTP server which allows bypassing the 'RequestHeader     unset' directives. An unauthenticated, remote attacker     can exploit this to inject arbitrary headers. This is     done by placing a header in the trailer portion of data     being sent using chunked transfer encoding.\n    (CVE-2013-5704)\n\n  - A flaw exists in the dav_xml_get_cdata() function in     file main/util.c within the HTTP server mod_dav module     due to incorrect stripping of whitespace characters from     the CDATA sections. An unauthenticated, remote attacker     via a specially crafted DAV WRITE request, can exploit     this to cause a denial of service condition.\n    (CVE-2013-6438)\n\n  - A flaw exists in the log_cookie() function in file     mod_log_config.c within the HTTP server mod_log_config     module due to improper handling of specially crafted     cookies during truncation. An unauthenticated, remote     attacker can exploit this to cause a denial of service     condition via a segmentation fault. (CVE-2014-0098)\n\n  - A flaw exists in libxml2, specifically in the     xmlParserHandlePEReference() function in file parser.c,     due to loading external parameter entities even when     entity substitution is disabled. An unauthenticated,     remote attacker can exploit this issue, via a specially     crafted XML file, to conduct XML External Entity (XXE)     attacks that exhaust CPU and memory resources, resulting     in a denial of service condition. (CVE-2014-0191)\n\n  - A race condition exists in the HTTP server within the     mod_status module when using a threaded Multi-Processing     Module (MPM). If an unauthenticated, remote attacker is     able to access status pages served by mod_status, the     attacker can exploit this issue, by sending specially     crafted requests, to cause the httpd child process to     crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with the     privileges of the user running the web server.\n    (CVE-2014-0226)\n\n  - An unspecified flaw exists in the Web Listener     subcomponent that allows an unauthenticated, remote     attacker to impact confidentiality, integrity, and     availability.

It is, therefore, affected by the multiple vulnerabilities :\n\n  - Multiple integer overflow conditions exist in the     bundled version of OpenSSL in files s3_srvr.c,     ssl_sess.c, and t1_lib.c due to improper use of pointer     arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to     cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-2177)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the     bundled version of OpenSSL in the dsa_sign_setup()     function in dsa_ossl.c due to a failure to properly     ensure the use of constant-time operations. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via a     timing side-channel attack, to disclose DSA key     information. (CVE-2016-2178)\n\n  - A vulnerability exists, known as SWEET32, in the bundled     version of OpenSSL in the 3DES and Blowfish algorithms     due to the use of weak 64-bit block ciphers by default.\n    A man-in-the-middle attacker who has sufficient     resources can exploit this vulnerability, via a     'birthday' attack, to detect a collision that leaks the     XOR between the fixed secret and a known plaintext,     allowing the disclosure of the secret text, such as     secure HTTPS cookies, and possibly resulting in the     hijacking of an authenticated session. (CVE-2016-2183)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists due to     the inclusion of sensitive information in error logs. An     authenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to     disclose information. (CVE-2016-2928)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists due to     the transmission of information in cleartext.

(CVE-2016-2932)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists due to a     flaw that allows traversing outside of a restricted     path. An authenticated, remote attacker can exploit     this, via a specially crafted request, to disclose     arbitrary files. (CVE-2016-2933)\n\n  - A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to     improper validation of user-supplied input. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via a     specially crafted request, to execute arbitrary script     code in a user's browser session. (CVE-2016-2934)\n\n  - An unspecified flaw exists that allows an     unauthenticated, remote attacker to submit invalid HTTP     requests, resulting in a denial of service condition for     the broker application. (CVE-2016-2935)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists due to     the storage of information in log files in plaintext. A     local attacker can exploit this to disclose sensitive     information. (CVE-2016-2943)\n\n  - A flaw exists in the bundled version of OpenSSL in the     ssl_parse_clienthello_tlsext() function in t1_lib.c due     to improper handling of overly large OCSP Status Request     extensions from clients. An unauthenticated, remote     attacker can exploit this, via large OCSP Status Request     extensions, to exhaust memory resources, resulting in a     denial of service condition. (CVE-2016-6304)\n\n  - An out-of-bounds read error exists the bundled version     of OpenSSL in the certificate parser that allows an     unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of     service via crafted certificate operations.\n    (CVE-2016-6306)\n\nNote that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.",

(CVE-2016-5546)\n\nIt was discovered that the 2D component of OpenJDK performed parsing of iTXt and zTXt PNG image chunks even when configured to ignore metadata. An attacker able to make a Java application parse a specially crafted PNG image could cause the application to consume an excessive amount of memory. (CVE-2017-3253)\n\nIt was discovered that the Libraries component of OpenJDK did not validate the length of the object identifier read from the DER input before allocating memory to store the OID. An attacker able to make a Java application decode a specially crafted DER input could cause the application to consume an excessive amount of memory. (CVE-2016-5547)\n\nIt was discovered that the JAAS component of OpenJDK did not use the correct way to extract user DN from the result of the user search LDAP query. A specially crafted user LDAP entry could cause the application to use an incorrect DN. (CVE-2017-3252)\n\nIt was discovered that the Networking component of OpenJDK failed to properly parse user info from the URL. A remote attacker could cause a Java application to incorrectly parse an attacker supplied URL and interpret it differently from other applications processing the same URL. (CVE-2016-5552)\n\nMultiple flaws were found in the Networking components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2017-3261 , CVE-2017-3231)\n\nA flaw was found in the way the DES/3DES cipher was used as part of the TLS/SSL protocol. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to recover some plaintext data by capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between TLS/SSL server and client if the communication used a DES/3DES based ciphersuite. (CVE-2016-2183) This update mitigates the CVE-2016-2183 issue by adding 3DES cipher suites to the list of legacy algorithms (defined using the jdk.tls.legacyAlgorithms security property) so they are only used if connecting TLS/SSL client and server do not share any other non-legacy cipher suite.",

An unauthenticated, remote     attacker can exploit this to cause a denial of service.\n    (CVE-2016-2177)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the     bundled version of OpenSSL in the dsa_sign_setup()     function in dsa_ossl.c due to a failure to properly     ensure the use of constant-time operations. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via a     timing side-channel attack, to disclose DSA key     information. (CVE-2016-2178)\n\n  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the bundled     version of OpenSSL in the DTLS implementation due to a     failure to properly restrict the lifetime of queue     entries associated with unused out-of-order messages. An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, by     maintaining multiple crafted DTLS sessions     simultaneously, to exhaust memory.

(CVE-2016-2180)\n\n  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the bundled     version of OpenSSL in the Anti-Replay feature in the     DTLS implementation due to improper handling of epoch     sequence numbers in records. An unauthenticated, remote     attacker can exploit this, via spoofed DTLS records, to     cause legitimate packets to be dropped.

            "description": "Security Fix(es) :\n\n  - A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled     TLS status request extension data during session     renegotiation. A remote attacker could cause a TLS     server using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of     memory and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting     all available memory, if it enabled OCSP stapling     support. (CVE-2016-6304)\n\n  - It was discovered that OpenSSL did not always use     constant time operations when computing Digital     Signature Algorithm (DSA) signatures. A local attacker     could possibly use this flaw to obtain a private DSA key     belonging to another user or service running on the same     system. (CVE-2016-2178)\n\n  - It was discovered that the Datagram TLS (DTLS)     implementation could fail to release memory in certain     cases. A malicious DTLS client could cause a DTLS server     using OpenSSL to consume an excessive amount of memory     and, possibly, exit unexpectedly after exhausting all     available memory. (CVE-2016-2179)\n\n  - A flaw was found in the Datagram TLS (DTLS) replay     protection implementation in OpenSSL. A remote attacker     could possibly use this flaw to make a DTLS server using     OpenSSL to reject further packets sent from a DTLS     client over an established DTLS connection.\n    (CVE-2016-2181)\n\n  - An out of bounds write flaw was discovered in the     OpenSSL BN_bn2dec() function. An attacker able to make     an application using OpenSSL to process a large BIGNUM     could cause the application to crash or, possibly,     execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-2182)\n\n  - A flaw was found in the DES/3DES cipher was used as part     of the TLS/SSL protocol. A man-in-the-middle attacker     could use this flaw to recover some plaintext data by     capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between     TLS/SSL server and client if the communication used a     DES/3DES based ciphersuite. (CVE-2016-2183)\n\nThis update mitigates the CVE-2016-2183 issue by lowering priority of DES cipher suites so they are not preferred over cipher suites using AES. For compatibility reasons, DES cipher suites remain enabled by default and included in the set of cipher suites identified by the HIGH cipher string. Future updates may move them to MEDIUM or not enable them by default.\n\n  - An integer underflow flaw leading to a buffer over-read     was found in the way OpenSSL parsed TLS session tickets.\n    A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash a TLS     server using OpenSSL if it used SHA-512 as HMAC for     session tickets. (CVE-2016-6302)\n\n  - Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the way     OpenSSL performed pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker     could possibly use these flaws to cause a TLS/SSL server     or client using OpenSSL to crash. (CVE-2016-2177)\n\n  - An out of bounds read flaw was found in the way OpenSSL     formatted Public Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol     data for printing. An attacker could possibly cause an     application using OpenSSL to crash if it printed time     stamp data from the attacker. (CVE-2016-2180)\n\n  - Multiple out of bounds read flaws were found in the way     OpenSSL handled certain TLS/SSL protocol handshake     messages. A remote attacker could possibly use these     flaws to crash a TLS/SSL server or client using OpenSSL.\n    (CVE-2016-6306)",
