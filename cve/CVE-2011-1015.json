The schizophrenic result is that many MS-based systems are required to understand both forms of the slash.

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.\n\nPython is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language.\n\nA flaw was found in the Python urllib and urllib2 libraries where they would not differentiate between different target URLs when handling automatic redirects. This caused Python applications using these modules to follow any new URL that they understood, including the 'file://' URL type. This could allow a remote server to force a local Python application to read a local file instead of the remote one, possibly exposing local files that were not meant to be exposed.\n(CVE-2011-1521)\n\nA race condition was found in the way the Python smtpd module handled new connections. A remote user could use this flaw to cause a Python script using the smtpd module to terminate. (CVE-2010-3493)\n\nAn information disclosure flaw was found in the way the Python CGIHTTPServer module processed certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted request to obtain the CGI script's source code. (CVE-2011-1015)\n\nA buffer over-read flaw was found in the way the Python Expat parser handled malformed UTF-8 sequences when processing XML files. A specially crafted XML file could cause Python applications using the Python Expat parser to crash while parsing the file. (CVE-2009-3720)\n\nThis update makes Python use the system Expat library rather than its own internal copy; therefore, users must have the version of Expat shipped with RHSA-2009:1625 installed, or a later version, to resolve the CVE-2009-3720 issue.\n\nAll Python users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.",
