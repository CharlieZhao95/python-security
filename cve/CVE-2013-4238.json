In a zone-based model, pages belong to one of a set of zones corresponding to the level of privilege assigned to that page. Pages in an untrusted zone would have a lesser level of access to the system and/or be restricted in the types of executable content it was allowed to invoke. In a cross-zone scripting attack, a page that should be assigned to a less privileged zone is granted the privileges of a more trusted zone. This can be accomplished by exploiting bugs in the browser, exploiting incorrect configuration in the zone controls, through a cross-site scripting attack that causes the attackers' content to be treated as coming from a more trusted page, or by leveraging some piece of system functionality that is accessible from both the trusted and less trusted zone. This attack differs from \"Restful Privilege Escalation\" in that the latter correlates to the inadequate securing of RESTful access methods (such as HTTP DELETE) on the server, while cross-zone scripting attacks the concept of security zones as implemented by a browser."

For example, many keywords are processed in a case insensitive manner. If the site's web filtering algorithm does not convert all tags into a consistent case before the comparison with forbidden keywords it is possible to bypass filters (e.g., incomplete black lists) by using an alternate case structure. For example, the \"script\" tag using the alternate forms of \"Script\" or \"ScRiPt\" may bypass filters where \"script\" is the only form tested. Other variants using different syntax representations are also possible as well as using pollution meta-characters or entities that are eventually ignored by the rendering engine.

An URL may contain special character that need special syntax handling in order to be interpreted. Special characters are represented using a percentage character followed by two digits representing the octet code of the original character (%HEX-CODE). For instance US-ASCII space character would be represented with %20. This is often referred as escaped ending or percent-encoding. Since the server decodes the URL from the requests, it may restrict the access to some URL paths by validating and filtering out the URL requests it received. An attacker will try to craft an URL with a sequence of special characters which once interpreted by the server will be equivalent to a forbidden URL. It can be difficult to protect against this attack since the URL can contain other format of encoding such as UTF-8 encoding, Unicode-encoding, etc. The attacker could also subvert the meaning of the URL string request by encoding the data being sent to the server through a GET request. For instance an attacker may subvert the meaning of parameters used in a SQL request and sent through the URL string (See Example section)."

Verify that your application conform to the latest UTF-8 encoding specification. Pay extra attention to the filtering of illegal characters.\nAnother consideration is error recovery. To guarantee correct recovery after corrupt or lost bytes, decoders must be able to recognize the difference between lead and trail bytes, rather than just assuming that bytes will be of the type allowed in their position.\nFor security reasons, a UTF-8 decoder must not accept UTF-8 sequences that are longer than necessary to encode a character.

            "description": "An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes multiple security issues and one bug is now available.\n\nThe Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.\n\nThe rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: a subset of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Agent.\n\nNote: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.\n\nUpgrade Note: If you upgrade the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor through the 3.2 Manager administration portal, the Host may appear with the status of 'Install Failed'. If this happens, place the host into maintenance mode, then activate it again to get the host back to an 'Up' state.\n\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the way QEMU processed the SCSI 'REPORT LUNS' command when more than 256 LUNs were specified for a single SCSI target. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to corrupt QEMU process memory on the host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process. (CVE-2013-4344)\n\nMultiple flaws were found in the way Linux kernel handled HID (Human Interface Device) reports. An attacker with physical access to the system could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2013-2888, CVE-2013-2889, CVE-2013-2892)\n\nA flaw was found in the way the Python SSL module handled X.509 certificate fields that contain a NULL byte. An attacker could potentially exploit this flaw to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to spoof SSL servers. Note that to exploit this issue, an attacker would need to obtain a carefully crafted certificate signed by an authority that the client trusts. (CVE-2013-4238)\n\nThe default OpenSSH configuration made it easy for remote attackers to exhaust unauthorized connection slots and prevent other users from being able to log in to a system. This flaw has been addressed by enabling random early connection drops by setting MaxStartups to 10:30:100 by default. For more information, refer to the sshd_config(5) man page. (CVE-2010-5107)\n\nThe CVE-2013-4344 issue was discovered by Asias He of Red Hat.\n\nThis updated package provides updated components that include fixes for various security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes included in this update address the following CVE numbers :\n\nCVE-2012-0786 and CVE-2012-0787 (augeas issues)\n\nCVE-2013-1813 (busybox issue)\n\nCVE-2013-0221, CVE-2013-0222, and CVE-2013-0223 (coreutils issues)\n\nCVE-2012-4453 (dracut issue)\n\nCVE-2013-4332, CVE-2013-0242, and CVE-2013-1914 (glibc issues)\n\nCVE-2013-4387, CVE-2013-0343, CVE-2013-4345, CVE-2013-4591, CVE-2013-4592, CVE-2012-6542, CVE-2013-3231, CVE-2013-1929, CVE-2012-6545, CVE-2013-1928, CVE-2013-2164, CVE-2013-2234, and CVE-2013-2851 (kernel issues)\n\nCVE-2013-4242 (libgcrypt issue)\n\nCVE-2013-4419 (libguestfs issue)\n\nCVE-2013-1775, CVE-2013-2776, and CVE-2013-2777 (sudo issues)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug :\n\n* A previous version of the rhev-hypervisor6 package did not contain the latest vhostmd package, which provides a 'metrics communication channel' between a host and its hosted virtual machines, allowing limited introspection of host resource usage from within virtual machines. This has been fixed, and rhev-hypervisor6 now includes the latest vhostmd package. (BZ#1026703)\n\nThis update also contains the fixes from the following errata :\n\n* ovirt-node: https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2013-1528.html\n\nUsers of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.",
