The attacker would typically control the value of such variable and try to get it out of range. For instance the integer in question is incremented past the maximum possible value, it may wrap to become a very small, or negative number, therefore providing a very incorrect value which can lead to unexpected behavior. At worst the attacker can execute arbitrary code."

An     unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to     access the Splunk REST API with the same rights as the     user.\n\nNote that the Python vulnerabilities stated above do not affect the Splunk Enterprise 6.4.x versions, and the HTTP request injection vulnerability does not affect the Splunk Light versions.",
