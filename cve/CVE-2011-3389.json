In a zone-based model, pages belong to one of a set of zones corresponding to the level of privilege assigned to that page. Pages in an untrusted zone would have a lesser level of access to the system and/or be restricted in the types of executable content it was allowed to invoke. In a cross-zone scripting attack, a page that should be assigned to a less privileged zone is granted the privileges of a more trusted zone. This can be accomplished by exploiting bugs in the browser, exploiting incorrect configuration in the zone controls, through a cross-site scripting attack that causes the attackers' content to be treated as coming from a more trusted page, or by leveraging some piece of system functionality that is accessible from both the trusted and less trusted zone. This attack differs from \"Restful Privilege Escalation\" in that the latter correlates to the inadequate securing of RESTful access methods (such as HTTP DELETE) on the server, while cross-zone scripting attacks the concept of security zones as implemented by a browser."

For example, many keywords are processed in a case insensitive manner. If the site's web filtering algorithm does not convert all tags into a consistent case before the comparison with forbidden keywords it is possible to bypass filters (e.g., incomplete black lists) by using an alternate case structure. For example, the \"script\" tag using the alternate forms of \"Script\" or \"ScRiPt\" may bypass filters where \"script\" is the only form tested. Other variants using different syntax representations are also possible as well as using pollution meta-characters or entities that are eventually ignored by the rendering engine.

An URL may contain special character that need special syntax handling in order to be interpreted. Special characters are represented using a percentage character followed by two digits representing the octet code of the original character (%HEX-CODE). For instance US-ASCII space character would be represented with %20. This is often referred as escaped ending or percent-encoding. Since the server decodes the URL from the requests, it may restrict the access to some URL paths by validating and filtering out the URL requests it received. An attacker will try to craft an URL with a sequence of special characters which once interpreted by the server will be equivalent to a forbidden URL. It can be difficult to protect against this attack since the URL can contain other format of encoding such as UTF-8 encoding, Unicode-encoding, etc. The attacker could also subvert the meaning of the URL string request by encoding the data being sent to the server through a GET request. For instance an attacker may subvert the meaning of parameters used in a SQL request and sent through the URL string (See Example section)."

Verify that your application conform to the latest UTF-8 encoding specification. Pay extra attention to the filtering of illegal characters.\nAnother consideration is error recovery. To guarantee correct recovery after corrupt or lost bytes, decoders must be able to recognize the difference between lead and trail bytes, rather than just assuming that bytes will be of the type allowed in their position.\nFor security reasons, a UTF-8 decoder must not accept UTF-8 sequences that are longer than necessary to encode a character.

The upstream patch for the chosen plaintext attack on the block-wise AES encryption algorithm (CVE-2011-3389) introduced a regression that caused TLS/SSL connections to fail when using certain algorithms. This update fixes the problem.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nDeepak Bhole discovered a flaw in the Same Origin Policy (SOP) implementation in the IcedTea web browser plugin. This could allow a remote attacker to open connections to certain hosts that should not be permitted. (CVE-2011-3377)\n\nJuliano Rizzo and Thai Duong discovered that the block-wise AES encryption algorithm block-wise as used in TLS/SSL was vulnerable to a chosen-plaintext attack. This could allow a remote attacker to view confidential data. (CVE-2011-3389)\n\nIt was discovered that a type confusion flaw existed in the in the Internet Inter-Orb Protocol (IIOP) deserialization code. A remote attacker could use this to cause an untrusted application or applet to execute arbitrary code by deserializing malicious input. (CVE-2011-3521)\n\nIt was discovered that the Java scripting engine did not perform SecurityManager checks. This could allow a remote attacker to cause an untrusted application or applet to execute arbitrary code with the full privileges of the JVM.\n(CVE-2011-3544)\n\nIt was discovered that the InputStream class used a global buffer to store input bytes skipped. An attacker could possibly use this to gain access to sensitive information.\n(CVE-2011-3547)\n\nIt was discovered that a vulnerability existed in the AWTKeyStroke class. A remote attacker could cause an untrusted application or applet to execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2011-3548)\n\nIt was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the TransformHelper class in the Java2D implementation. A remote attacker could use this cause a denial of service via an application or applet crash or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2011-3551)\n\nIt was discovered that the default number of available UDP sockets for applications running under SecurityManager restrictions was set too high. A remote attacker could use this with a malicious application or applet exhaust the number of available UDP sockets to cause a denial of service for other applets or applications running within the same JVM. (CVE-2011-3552)\n\nIt was discovered that Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) could incorrectly expose a stack trace. A remote attacker could potentially use this to gain access to sensitive information. (CVE-2011-3553)\n\nIt was discovered that the unpacker for pack200 JAR files did not sufficiently check for errors. An attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code through a specially crafted pack200 JAR file.\n(CVE-2011-3554)\n\nIt was discovered that the RMI registration implementation did not properly restrict privileges of remotely executed code. A remote attacker could use this to execute code with elevated privileges. (CVE-2011-3556, CVE-2011-3557)\n\nIt was discovered that the HotSpot VM could be made to crash, allowing an attacker to cause a denial of service or possibly leak sensitive information. (CVE-2011-3558)\n\nIt was discovered that the HttpsURLConnection class did not properly perform SecurityManager checks in certain situations. This could allow a remote attacker to bypass restrictions on HTTPS connections. (CVE-2011-3560).\n\nNote that Tenable Network Security has extracted the preceding description block directly from the Ubuntu security advisory. Tenable has attempted to automatically clean and format it as much as possible without introducing additional issues.",

If a local user had access to the home directory of another user who is running distutils, they could use this flaw to gain access to that user's .pypirc file, which can contain usernames and passwords for code repositories (CVE-2011-4944).\n\nA flaw was found in the way the Python SimpleXMLRPCServer module handled clients disconnecting prematurely. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause excessive CPU consumption on a server using SimpleXMLRPCServer (CVE-2012-0845).\n\nHash table collisions CPU usage DoS for the embedded copy of expat (CVE-2012-0876).\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the implementation of associative arrays (dictionaries) in Python. An attacker able to supply a large number of inputs to a Python application (such as HTTP POST request parameters sent to a web application) that are used as keys when inserting data into an array could trigger multiple hash function collisions, making array operations take an excessive amount of CPU time. To mitigate this issue, randomization has been added to the hash function to reduce the chance of an attacker successfully causing intentional collisions (CVE-2012-1150).\n\nThe updated packages have been patched to correct these issues.",

It does not detect the BEAST attack where it exploits the vulnerability at HTTPS client-side (i.e., Internet browser). The detection at server-side does not necessarily mean your server is vulnerable to the BEAST attack, because the attack exploits the vulnerability at the client-side, and both SSL/TLS clients and servers can independently employ the split record countermeasure.",
